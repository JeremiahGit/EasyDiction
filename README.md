#AutoHotKey Microsfot Word Easy Diction 

These AutoHotKey scripts are designed for my senior capstone course "Engineering 
Design and Devolepment". The purpose of these scripts is to help a blind individual 
using Microsfot Word 365 review what they have typed immediately after they type.
This is possible through MSWords's built in diction reader and its' shortcut
which corosponds to the keys [Control] + [Alt] + [Spacebar].
